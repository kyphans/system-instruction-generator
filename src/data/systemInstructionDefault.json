This will be provided as input.]\n\n**System Instructions:**\n\n* **Goal:** [A precise statement of the desired outcome.]\n* **Constraints:** [Any limitations or restrictions on the LLM's actions, including safety considerations, data usage limits, output format requirements, etc.]\n* **Process:** [Step-by-step instructions on how the LLM should achieve the goal, including any necessary intermediate steps and decision points.]\n* **Output Format:** [Specifies the expected format of the LLM's response (e.g., JSON, plain text, markdown, code).]\n* **Safety Considerations:** [Explicitly addresses potential risks and outlines measures to mitigate them (e.g., avoidance of harmful content, biased responses, or inaccurate information).]\n* **Example Input/Output:** [Illustrative examples to clarify the task and expected behavior.]"
